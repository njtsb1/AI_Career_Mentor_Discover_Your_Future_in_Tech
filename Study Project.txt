## Interview Script

Question 1: What is the DOM and how to manipulate it?  
Answer: It is the representation of the HTML structure in memory and can be manipulated via JavaScript.

Answer: Props are data passed from a parent to a child component; state is internal and managed by the component.  

Question 3: How to ensure performance in a React application?  
Answer: Use memoization, lazy loading, split code into smaller components, and avoid unnecessary re-renders.  

Question 4: What is responsiveness and how to apply it?  
Answer: It is adapting the interface to different screen sizes using CSS (media queries, Flexbox, Grid).  

Question 5: What is the difference between SPA and MPA?
